Images - The blueprints of our application which form the basis of containers.
In the demo above, we used the docker pull command to download the busybox
image.Containers - Created from Docker images and run the actual application.
We create a container using docker run which we did using the busybox image that
we downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the docker ps
command.

Docker Daemon - The background service running on the host that manages
building, running and distributing Docker containers. The daemon is the process
that runs in the operating system to which clients talk to.

Docker Client - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the
daemon. More generally, there can be other forms of clients too - such as
Kitematic which provide a GUI to the users.

Docker Hub - A registry of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a
directory of all available Docker images. If required, one can host their own
Docker registries and can use them for pulling images.

Base images - Are images that have no parent image, usually images with an OS
like ubuntu, busybox or debian.

Child images - are images that build on base images and add additional
functionality.

Official images - Are images that are officially maintained and supported by the
folks at Docker. These are typically one word long. In the list of images above,
the python, ubuntu, busybox and hello-world images are official images.

User images - Are images created and shared by users like you and me. They build
on base images and add additional functionality. Typically, these are formatted
as user/image-name.
